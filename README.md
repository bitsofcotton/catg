categorize series of inputs into svd vector.

# Description
If there's a series of the vector {a_1,...,a_n}, SVD can decompose them into left and right unitary matrix.
So with non constant n, series of {a_1, ..., a_n0}, {a_n1,...,a_n} we can define series of decomposition of them.  
So we can use right unitary matrix to categorize input, also left and singular values to categorize output.
